### AI Play

- "Curious about AI? Let's play with it first!"
- A web application that allows users to experience deep learning alongside machine learning.
- Provides the ability to connect several models belonging to natural language processing (NLP) or computer vision (CV) through an API, allowing users to get simple results by inputting values.
  - The goal is to make experiencing the model more interesting than a simple input-output.
  - Examples: Upload a face photo - (Object Detection) - Find fruits that resemble the face.
  - Enter the sentence, "I'm hungry today. So," - (Text Generation) - "I'm hungry today. So, let's eat chicken elegantly."

### Main Service: MalLang MalLang

- Make the rigid machine learning **soft and flexible**!
- A web application service that allows users to create machine learning models even if they are not familiar with machine learning.
- The entire machine learning process (EDA, Feature Engineering, Training, ...) can be performed using a GUI (mouse click + simple value input).
